# HandSPASMS

Developed for the Wireless Access for Health (WAH) initative in the Phillipines,
as part of IDHack 2016. Developed to allow the organization to send out
Synchronized Patient Alerts via SMS (SPASMS) from their web-based application,
which in turn allows for increased access to medical records for people who are
often not internet connected.

Input: HTTP Requests (presumably from the WAH application)

Output: SPASM alerts, as well as a clear confirmation on the Android phone log
of the message's send status (IE Sent, Fail due to Bad Reception, etc.)
